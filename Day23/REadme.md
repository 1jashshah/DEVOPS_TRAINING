### **Part 1: Implementing a Custom IAM Policy for S3 Access**

**Scenario:\
**You have a scenario where a development team needs access to an S3
bucket containing logs generated by an application. Only a specific IAM
role, \"DevTeamRole,\" should have permission to list and read objects
in this bucket, while no other actions should be allowed. The
participants will implement this policy to meet this requirement.

#### **Steps:**

1.  **Understand the Requirements:**

    -   Review the scenario where only the \"DevTeamRole\" is allowed to
        > access the S3 bucket named application-logs.

    -   The policy should only permit s3:ListBucket and s3:GetObject
        > actions on this bucket.

2.  **Create a New IAM Policy:**

    -   Navigate to the IAM console and create a new custom policy.

    -   Define the policy to allow s3:ListBucket and s3:GetObject
        > actions.

    -   Specify the ARN of the application-logs bucket and any specific
        > objects within the bucket as resources.

3.  **Attach the Policy to the IAM Role:**

    -   Attach the custom policy to the \"DevTeamRole\" role.

    -   Ensure that no other users or roles are granted access to this
        > bucket by this policy.

4.  **Test the Policy:**

    -   Attempt to access the S3 bucket using the \"DevTeamRole\" to
        > ensure only the allowed actions (list and read) are permitted.

    -   Document the results of the test, ensuring that actions outside
        > of the allowed scope (e.g., delete, write) are correctly
        > denied.

### **Part 2: Estimating a Multi-Tier Architecture Solution**

**Scenario:\
**You need to design and estimate the cost for a scalable web
application that includes a load balancer, a set of EC2 instances for
the application tier, and an RDS database for the data tier. The
solution must support a user base of up to 100,000 concurrent users.

#### **Steps:**

1.  **Define the Architecture:**

    -   Identify the components required: an Application Load Balancer,
        > EC2 instances for the application servers, and an RDS instance
        > for the database.

    -   Consider the expected traffic and choose appropriate EC2
        > instance types and RDS configurations.

2.  **Select AWS Services:**

    -   Choose an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming
        > traffic.

    -   ![](photos/media/image1.png)

    -   Select EC2 instance types (e.g., t3.medium) that can handle the
        > application load.

    -   ![](photos/media/image8.png)

    -   Choose an RDS instance type (e.g., db.m5.large) to support the
        > database.

    -   ![](photos/media/image6.png)

3.  **Document and Analyze the Estimate:**

    -   Review the total estimated monthly cost.

    -   Identify any areas where cost-saving measures could be applied
        > (e.g., reserved instances, using Auto Scaling to optimize EC2
        > usage).
