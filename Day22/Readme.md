####  **Configuring Jobs and Targets**

-   **Task:** Set up a Prometheus server to monitor multiple services
    > running on different nodes.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Configure Prometheus with jobs for monitoring different services
        > like web servers, databases, and system metrics.

    -   Define static and dynamic targets using file-based and service
        > discovery methods (e.g., Consul or Kubernetes).

#### **2. Using Exporters (Node Exporter)**

-   **Task:** Use Node Exporter to monitor system-level metrics like
    > CPU, memory, disk usage, and network statistics.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Install and configure Node Exporter on all nodes.

    -   Ensure Node Exporter metrics are being correctly scraped by
        > Prometheus.

#### **3. Hands-on Exercise: Setting Up Exporters**

-   **Task:** Configure at least two different types of exporters (e.g.,
    > Node Exporter and MySQL Exporter) and integrate them with
    > Prometheus.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Demonstrate successful data collection from both exporters.

    -   Create a basic Prometheus dashboard to visualize key metrics
        > from these exporters.

#### **4. Introduction to PromQL**

-   **Task:** Learn and implement basic PromQL queries to extract
    > meaningful data from the metrics collected.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Write basic queries to retrieve metrics like average CPU usage,
        > memory consumption, and disk I/O over time.

**Graph of average CPU usage**

avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"user\"}\[5m\])) by (instance)

#### **5. Basic Queries (Selectors, Functions, Operators)**

-   **Task:** Create PromQL queries using selectors, functions, and
    > operators to filter and manipulate time-series data.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Write PromQL queries to calculate the 95th percentile of CPU
        > usage.

    -   Use functions like rate(), increase(), and histogram_quantile()
        > to perform more complex analysis.

#### **6. Configuring Alertmanager**

-   **Task:** Set up Alertmanager to handle alerts generated by
    > Prometheus.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Configure Alertmanager with Prometheus.

    -   Create routing rules to manage alert notifications based on
        > severity and service type.

#### **7. Writing Alerting Rules**

-   **Task:** Write custom alerting rules in Prometheus to trigger
    > alerts based on specific conditions.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Create alerting rules for high CPU usage, memory leaks, and disk
        > space running low.

    -   Ensure alerts are correctly generated and sent to Alertmanager.

#### **8. Setting Up Notification Channels (Email, Slack, etc.)**

-   **Task:** Integrate Alertmanager with multiple notification channels
    > like Email and Slack.

-   **Deliverables:**

    -   Set up Email notifications for critical alerts.

    -   Integrate Slack for real-time alerts and notifications.
